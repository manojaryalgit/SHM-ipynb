# 🧭 Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) Simulator

This project simulates and visualizes **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)** of a mass-spring system using Python. It's a great tool for learning about oscillatory systems and energy conservation in classical mechanics.

## 📚 Features

✅ Simulates the motion of a mass on a spring  
✅ Visualizes:

- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration over time
- Phase space diagram (x vs. v)
- Kinetic, potential, and total energy vs. time  

✅ Modular, clean Python code in a single Jupyter notebook  
✅ Ready for further extension (e.g., damping, external force, interactivity)

## 🧠 Physics Behind It

The system is governed by **Hooke’s Law**:  
\[ F = -kx \]  

And the solution follows the form:  
\[ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) \]  

Where:  
- `A` is the amplitude  
- `ω = √(k/m)` is the angular frequency  
- `φ` is the phase constant
